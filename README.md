# 3-D Ising Nucleation with ML-Accelerated Sampling

This repository will hold:
1. A 3-D Ising Monte-Carlo engine.
2. Transition-Path Sampling (TPS) + Forward-Flux Sampling (FFS) scripts.
3. A convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns the committor
   function and speeds up rare-event sampling.
